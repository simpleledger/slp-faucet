We are not responsible for any loss of funds as a result of your use or misuse of this faucet.  Do not store large values or amounts on the mnemonic seed phrase in order to minimize your risk for financial loss. You should generate a brand new 12-word seed phrase to use exclusively for this faucet, this is your secret mnemonic seed phrase that will be used to automatically distribute your token when users paste their SLP address.
